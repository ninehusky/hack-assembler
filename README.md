# hack-assembler
An assembler for the Hack Machine Language written in Java.
Takes in an .asm file written in Hack and outputs to a
.hack file that contains the file's corresponding binary translation.

## Specifics
This assembler was built by referring to the specification found in the
materials relating to [Project 6](https://www.nand2tetris.org/project06) of the
nand2tetris course.

## What did I learn?
This project's semi-complicated directory structure comes from learning
Maven at the same time. Future updates to the repository will involve
creating an executable .jar file and some test .asm programs.

I also learned more about the assembly process as a whole, and this will
undoubtedly come in handy as I tackle the more complicated process of
creating an emulator that reads and decodes ROM files.
